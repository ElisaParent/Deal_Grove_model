# Deal_Grove_model
Teaching notes and programs for teaching oxidation of silicon using the Deal Grove model
Using the Deal Grove model, These programs show wet and dry oxidation time vs thickness. The first set of pictures is on a linear scale to show both the linear and quadratic rate regions, and the following picture is on a log scale to highlight the differences between temperatures. The legends are for the colors on both of the models.
